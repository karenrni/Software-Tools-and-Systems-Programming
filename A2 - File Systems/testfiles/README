This directory contains some example input files for the ffsim and bfsim 
programs.  The corresponding .out files are the result of running ffsim
on the input file.
create_in.txt  init_in.txt  README  test_diagram  test_diagram.out  test_init

init_in.txt - the simplest transaction file that creates an empty file system
    - this test will produce the correct output with only the starter code
create_in.txt - create one file
    - with the the starter code, the correct metadata will be set, but the 
    freelist will be incorrect and the file data will not be stored in the 
    data portion of the disk
test_diagram.txt - the transaction file used for the diagrams in the handout
test_diagram.txt - the expected output for the test_diagram.txt (The results
    are the same for both ffsim and bfsim
test_sample.txt - the transaction file from the handout
test_sample.out - the result of running `./ffsim testfiles/test_sample.txt` 

NOTE: When you run the starter code on these transaction files, you will NOT
get the same output, except init_in.txt
