Test 1: Create 4 consecutive files, delete three files 
Transaction file: test_four.txt
Tests the creation of four consecutive files and deletion of three of them. 
Verifies that the free list correctly merges 2 separate, adjacent free blocks when files 
are deleted, creating a contiguous free block.

Test 2: Create 3 consecutive files, delete all but middle files (file adjacent to both other files)
Transaction file: test_non_con.txt
Tests that 3 consecutive files are created, and the freelist is updated correctly.
When each file is deleted, the freelist will increase by a node, as no merging occurs.

Test 3: Create 3 consecutive files, delete all 
Transaction file: test_three_con.txt
Tests that three consecutive files are created and the freelist merges all 
blocks when after each file is deleted

Test 4: Create multiple files, delete selected files 
Transaction file: test_first_fit.txt
Tests that get_free_block with first fit finds the first available free space, 
over better, later blocks. 

Test 5: Create files with different sizes, delete selected files
Transaction file: test_best.txt
Tests that get_free_block using best fit finds the smallest available free space,
which is the only space with exact fit.  

Test 6: Fragmented space, attempt to create an oversized file
Transaction file: test_no_fit.txt
Tests that get_free_block in either first or best fit 
handles cases where no free block is large enough for a new file,
meaning a return value of -1 is recieved in place of a block.
